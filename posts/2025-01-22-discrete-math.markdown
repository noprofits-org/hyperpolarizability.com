Today, we're diving into a bit of elementary number theory to prove a specific inequality. We aim to demonstrate that for positive integers *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 4, the inequality *n*² + 1 ≥ 2*ⁿ* holds true. This isn't a general proof for all integers, mind you, just for this specific range! It's a nice, concrete exercise that illustrates the concept of proof by cases.

Essentially, we will show this to be true by checking every single case in the given range. Let's get started.

### Case 1: n = 1

When *n* = 1, the left side of the inequality becomes:

1² + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

The right side of the inequality is:

2¹ = 2

Thus, 2 ≥ 2, which is a true statement. The inequality holds for *n* = 1.

### Case 2: n = 2

When *n* = 2, the left side of the inequality is:

2² + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

The right side of the inequality is:

2² = 4

Thus, 5 ≥ 4, which is true. The inequality holds for *n* = 2.

### Case 3: n = 3

When *n* = 3, the left side becomes:

3² + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10

The right side becomes:

2³ = 8

Thus, 10 ≥ 8, which is true. The inequality holds for *n* = 3.

### Case 4: n = 4

When *n* = 4, the left side becomes:

4² + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17

The right side becomes:

2⁴ = 16

Thus, 17 ≥ 16, which is true. The inequality holds for *n* = 4.

## Conclusion

We have shown, through a case-by-case analysis, that the inequality *n*² + 1 ≥ 2*ⁿ* holds true for *n* = 1, 2, 3, and 4. While this method is only viable for a finite number of cases, it's a solid approach to demonstrate a statement within a specific range, as we just did. This simple example also demonstrates how a mathematical statement may hold true in a certain range but not generally (e.g., for n>4, this inequality does not hold). It is important to be specific in the limitations of your conclusions.
