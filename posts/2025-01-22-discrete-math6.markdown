Today, we're diving into the world of linear algebra to explore how to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix. Specifically, we'll demonstrate the formula for the inverse and prove that it's correct. The key here is to use matrix notation and perform some basic matrix multiplication.

### Understanding the Problem

A matrix, *A*, has an inverse, *A⁻¹*, if when multiplied by *A* in either order (i.e., *AA⁻¹* or *A⁻¹A*), the result is the identity matrix, denoted as *I*. For a 2x2 matrix, the identity matrix is:

$I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

We are given a 2x2 matrix *A*:

$A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$

And we are told that if *ad - bc ≠ 0*, then the inverse of A, denoted as *A⁻¹*, is:

$A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{d}{ad-bc} & \frac{-b}{ad-bc} \\ \frac{-c}{ad-bc} & \frac{a}{ad-bc} \end{bmatrix}$

Our goal is to prove that *A⁻¹* as defined above is indeed the inverse of *A* by showing that  *AA⁻¹* = *I*. We will be using the standard matrix multiplication rules.

### Proof of the Inverse Formula

To prove this, we need to perform the matrix multiplication of *A* and *A⁻¹* and show that the resulting matrix is the identity matrix *I*:

$AA^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{d}{ad-bc} & \frac{-b}{ad-bc} \\ \frac{-c}{ad-bc} & \frac{a}{ad-bc} \end{bmatrix}$

Performing matrix multiplication, we get:

$AA^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} a \cdot \frac{d}{ad-bc} + b \cdot \frac{-c}{ad-bc} & a \cdot \frac{-b}{ad-bc} + b \cdot \frac{a}{ad-bc} \\ c \cdot \frac{d}{ad-bc} + d \cdot \frac{-c}{ad-bc} & c \cdot \frac{-b}{ad-bc} + d \cdot \frac{a}{ad-bc} \end{bmatrix}$

Simplifying each term:

$AA^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{ad-bc}{ad-bc} & \frac{-ab+ba}{ad-bc} \\ \frac{cd-dc}{ad-bc} & \frac{-cb+da}{ad-bc} \end{bmatrix}$

Further simplification yields:

$AA^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

Which is the identity matrix, *I*.

### The Determinant

The quantity *ad - bc* is known as the *determinant* of the matrix *A*. It is often denoted as det(A). The condition that *ad - bc ≠ 0* is crucial because if the determinant is zero, the matrix has no inverse (division by zero). A matrix with a determinant of zero is called a singular matrix.

### Conclusion

We have successfully demonstrated, by direct matrix multiplication, that:

$AA^{-1} = I$

when:

$A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$

and

$A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{d}{ad-bc} & \frac{-b}{ad-bc} \\ \frac{-c}{ad-bc} & \frac{a}{ad-bc} \end{bmatrix}$

provided that *ad - bc ≠ 0*.

This proof confirms the formula for the inverse of a 2x2 matrix and highlights the importance of the determinant in determining whether a matrix has an inverse. This result is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and finds wide applications in various fields, from computer graphics to solving systems of linear equations.
