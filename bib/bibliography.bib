Light enhancement and confinement is caused by large discontinuity of the electric field at high-index-contrast interfaces. We show that by use of such a structure the field can be confined in a 50-nm-wide low-index region with a normalized intensity of 20{\textmu}m-2. This intensity is approximately 20 times higher than what can be achieved in SiO2 with conventional rectangular waveguides.},

    abstract = { We have successfully utilized epoxyisophorone ring-opening chemistry to efficiently incorporate the butylthio group to the phenyltetraene bridge of highly efficient nonlinear optical chromophores in high overall yield. By following the guidance of Dewar’s rules, the sulfur atom functions as a moderate  $/pi$-accepting group at a starred position of the conjugated bridge. Several of very critical material parameters of the phenyltetraenic chromophores for device applications have been intrinsically and simultaneously improved through such a simple and straightforward engineering of molecular structures. Compared with the nonsubstituted analogue 2, thiolated chromophore 1 achieves higher molecular hyperpolarizability (34\%), enhanced E-O coefficient (38\%), significantly improved photochemical stability against 1O2 (by an order of magnitude), and better optical transparency (17 nm blue-shifted λmax absorption spectrum). }

Recent advances in this field have shown remarkable monolithic integration capabilities for both passive and active optical components on the same chip.

abstract = {Organic nonlinear optical materials have proven to possess high and extremely fast nonlinearities compared to conventional inorganic crystals, allowing for sub-1-V driving voltages and modulation bandwidths of over 100 GHz. Compared to more widely studied poled electro-optic polymers, organic electro-optic crystals exhibit orders of magnitude better thermal and photochemical stability. The lack of available structuring techniques for organic crystals has been the major drawback for exploring their potential for photonic structures. Here we present a new approach to fabricate high-quality electro-optic single crystal waveguides and nanowires of configurationally locked polyene DAT2 (2-(3-(2-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)vinyl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-enylidene)malononitrile). The high-index-contrast waveguides (\&\#x394;n $=$ 0.54 {\textpm} 0.04) are grown from the melt between two anodically bonded borosilicate glass wafers, which are structured andequipped with electrodes prior to bonding. Electro-optic phase modulationis demonstrated for the first time in the non-centrosymmetric DAT2 singlecrystalline channel waveguides at a wavelength of 1.55 $\mu$m. We also showthat this technique in combination with DAT2 material allows for thefabrication of single-crystalline nanostructures inside large-area deviceswith crystal thicknesses below 30 nm and lengths of above 7 mm.},

Conjugated polymers are beginning to find uses, in both the neutral and the doped states, in prototype molecular-based electronics applications and in electronic and opto-electronic devices. The physical basis for the many of the unusual properties of these new materials is discussed, at a sufficient level of approximation to enable an understanding of the important issues by the general condensed matter physicist. In particular, emphasis is placed on the interconnections of the electronic, geometric and chemical structures, in the ground state and especially in the excited states. The important role of electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions are pointed out, and justified through a combined experimental-theoretical approach. "

abstract = {It has been commonly assumed that electrostatic interactions between chromophores that exhibit large second hyperpolarizabilities $\beta$ can be neglected in estimating electro-optic and second-harmonic coefficients, which can be achieved by electric-field poling of chromophore-containing polymers. Macroscopic optical nonlinearity has been assumed to scale as $\mu$$\beta$/molecular weight, where $\mu$ is the dipole moment. Synthesis of chromophores with $\mu$$\beta$ values of the order of 10{\textminus}44 esu has led to expectations of electro-optic coefficients for organic materials that substantially exceed those of lithium niobate. Expected values have not been easily realized; thus the utility of the above-mentioned scaling factor or chromophore figure of merit has been brought into question. We demonstrate that macroscopic optical nonlinearities are attenuated at high chromophore loading for chromophores characterized by electrostatic interactions that, at close approach distances, exceed thermal energies (kT) and poling energies ($\mu$F), where F is the effective electric field.},

abstract = {Liquid crystals and polymer glasses can be formed into orientationally ordered materials by raising the temperature of the material to a temperature at which molecular motion is greatly enhanced, applying an external aligning field, and then cooling with the field applied. The resulting material exhibits second-order nonlinear-optical effects. In this paper, the relationship between the molecular hyperpolarizability and the macroscopic susceptibility is presented. The susceptibility is seen to depend on the microscopic order parameters commonly associated with liquid crystals and is discussed in the limits of one-dimensional molecules and poled polymer glasses. Agreement is found between the theory and second-harmonic-generation measurements of polymer glasses. Results of electro-optic measurements are compared with second-harmonic-generation measurements that suggest that the electro-optic effect is mostly electronic in origin.},

abstract = "The magnitude and stability of the induced dipolar orientation of 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (MNA)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) guest/host system is investigated. The chromophores are aligned using both the corona discharge and contact electrode poling techniques. The magnitude of order parameter (also an indicator for the second order nonlinear susceptibility) is measured by recording absorbances of the poled (by the two different techniques) and unpoled \{PMMA\} films at different concentrations of MNA. Under the same conditions the corona poling technique creates a higher alignment of molecules along the field direction. The time dependence of the second harmonic intensity of the MNA/PMMA film prepared by the two techniques can be described by a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts stretched exponential. The temperature dependence of the decay time constant is found to generally follow a modified Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) or Vogel-Tamann-Fulcher (VTF) equation. The glass transition temperature seems to be the single most important parameter for determining the relaxation time τ(T). "

These new binary-chromophore materials exhibit EO coefficients (r33) in the range of 250 to greater than 300 pm/V (currently as high as 450 pm/V). The EO activity of these binary-chromophore materials is greater the sum of their individual components. The experimentally observed increase in the nonlinear optical response of two representative classes of EO chromophore-EO dendrimer and EO chromophore-EO polymer mixtures relative to the response of the isolated components is described quantitatively herein by a physical model that accounts for cooperativity in the guest-host interactions. }

abstract={Photonic wire bonding is demonstrated to enable highly efficient coupling between multicore fibers and planar silicon photonic circuits. The technique relies on in-situ fabrication of three-dimensional interconnect waveguides between the fiber facet and tapered silicon-on-insulator waveguides. Photonic wire bonding can easily compensate inaccuracies of core placement in the fiber cross-section, does not require active alignment, and is well suited for automated fabrication. We report on the design, on fabrication, and on characterization of photonic wire bonds. In a proof-of-principle experiment, a four-core fiber is coupled to a silicon photonic chip, leading to measured coupling losses as small as 1.7 dB.},

abstract = {Photonic integration requires a versatile packaging technology that enables low-loss interconnects between photonic chips in three-dimensional configurations. In this paper we introduce the concept of photonic wire bonding, where polymer waveguides with three-dimensional freeform geometries are used to bridge the gap between nanophotonic circuits located on different chips. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the fabrication of single-mode photonic wire bonds (PWB) by direct-write two-photon lithography. First-generation prototypes allow for efficient broadband coupling with average insertion losses of only 1.6 dB in the C-band and can carry wavelength-division multiplexing signals with multi-Tbit/s data rates. Photonic wire bonding is well suited for automated mass production, and we expect the technology to enable optical multi-chip systems with enhanced performance and flexibility.},

Hybrid systems encompass the optical and/or electrical components that form intimate contact with OEO materials, such as metal oxide barrier layers, solution processable passive waveguides, silicon nanoslots, and photonic CMOS chips, etc. These systems offer unique advantages combining excellent properties and simple processing for advanced photonic device platforms.

    abstract = { A comprehensive theoretical and experimental study of the bromo effect on Diels-Alder (DA) and retro-Diels-Alder (rDA) reactions between the anthracene-containing dienes and maleimide dienophile has been conducted to improve thermal stability and poling efficiency of electro-optic (EO) polymers. Calculations with density functional theory (DFT) reveal that the bromo substitution on anthracene-based dienes leads to significantly increased cycloaddition exothermicities (9-12 kcal/mol) but has a minor effect on their activation barriers (0.6-3 kcal/mol) when reacted with N-phenylmaleimide dienophile. These calculated values correlate very well with the experimental results obtained from a series of model compounds. The DA/rDA cross-linking protocols based on these compounds can be applied to several nonlinear optical (NLO) polymers and result in large EO coefficients (r33) (as high as 69 pm/V) and greatly improved thermal stability (up to 250 °C). This demonstrates that controlled DA/rDA reactions can be used to improve the performance of EO polymers for chip-scale interconnects that requires very high thermal stability. }

abstract={Electro-optic modulation at frequencies of 100[emsp14]GHz and beyond is important for photonic-electronic signal processing at the highest speeds. To date, however, only a small number of devices exist that can operate up to this frequency. In this study, we demonstrate that this frequency range can be addressed by nanophotonic, silicon-based modulators. We exploit the ultrafast Pockels effect by using the silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) platform, which combines highly nonlinear organic molecules with silicon waveguides. Until now, the bandwidth of these devices was limited by the losses of the radiofrequency (RF) signal and the RC (resistor-capacitor) time constant of the silicon structure. The RF losses are overcome by using a device as short as 500[emsp14][micro]m, and the RC time constant is decreased by using a highly conductive electron accumulation layer and an improved gate insulator. Using this method, we demonstrate for the first time an integrated silicon modulator with a 3dB bandwidth at an operating frequency beyond 100[emsp14]GHz. Our results clearly indicate that the RC time constant is not a fundamental speed limitation of SOH devices at these frequencies. Our device has a voltage-length product of only V[pgr]L=11[emsp14]V mm, which compares favorably with the best silicon-photonic modulators available today. Using cladding materials with stronger nonlinearities, the voltage-length product is expected to improve by more than an order of magnitude.},

abstract  ="We have developed a series of novel monolithic materials based on molecules previously explored as dopants in guest-host systems to study intrinsic structure-function relationships in organic electro-optic (EO) materials. In a library of EO molecules with varied bridge segments{,} molecular modification of the donor with bis(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl) groups led to improvement in formation of amorphous films and led to enhanced poling efficiency. Further modification to include a carbazole site-isolation group on the bridge effectively reduced intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions{,} led to a material with poling efficiency of approximately 3 (nm/V)2{,} and an increased glass transition temperature to 20-40 ?C higher than similar reported monolithic materials. This level of thermal stability is comparable to common guest/host systems{,} which incorporated poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the host. Our research showed that [small pi]-bridge length and type impacted first molecular hyperpolarizability [small beta] of a chromophore{,} which is accordingly reflected in the EO response. These findings further promote the utility of monolithic materials for their increased EO behavior and improved thermal stability{,} making this material system a competitor of guest-host systems in commercial applications."}

abstract = {Presented is the effect of using various cladding materials with different conductivities and dielectric constants on the applied voltage for optoelectronic (OE) devices based on nonlinear optical (NLO) polymers. Using a conductive polymer, we have demonstrated a 3 to 13 times increase in the effective electro-optic (EO) coefficient of electrode-poled NLO polymers, compared to using passive polymer claddings. We have achieved the lowest poling voltage to date for maximum EO coefficient, 300 V, for a two-layer waveguide structure consisting of a 2-μm-thick NLO polymer layer and a 2-μm-thick conductive cladding layer. The dielectric constants of both the NLO polymer core and passive polymer cladding materials used for conventional polymer-based integrated optic devices are typically very similar in magnitude. This suggests that only a small fraction of the applied modulation voltage is reaching the NLO polymer core layer, requiring 4 to 5 times higher modulation voltage than the desired V $/pi$. We have demonstrated a factor-of-2 decrease in the modulation voltage using the same conductive polymer, due to its possessing a much higher dielectric constant than the core material at the modulation frequency tested. The results show promise for shorter, lower-operating-voltage devices. © 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

Current densities appeared to be interface (electrode) limited, with little dependence on the work function of the metal for the top electrode (Bardeen barrier at the electrode--dielectric interface), whereas for the bottom electrode--dielectric interface a dependence on the work function of the metal was observed. The field dependence of the current density was found to be Schottky charge emission for medium field strengths (EPOL$\leq$100 V/$\mu$m), whereas it was dominated by Fowler--Nordheim tunneling at higher poling fields. In the presence of an additional inorganic barrier layer, significant suppression of tunneling was observed, which led to a reduced probability of singular breakdown events and shifted the limit of avalanche breakdown to higher internal effective poling field strengths.},

abstract  ="Significantly enhanced temporal stability of poled electro-optic (E-O) polymers could be achieved by inserting a thin sol-gel derived titanium dioxide (\ce{TiO2}) barrier layer in the high electric field poling process. The resulting poled film can retain >90\% of its original r33 value (169 pm V-1 at 1310 nm) after being annealed at 85 [degree]C for 500 h. This is significantly higher ([similar]30\%) compared to that obtained without the \ce{TiO2} layer. This barrier approach is also applicable to a variety of dielectric polymers although the degree of enhancement varies. The enhanced temporal stability of E-O polymers is attributed to reduced charge injection/accumulation that improves the stability of screening charges for poled films."}

abstract="Titanium dioxide (\ce{TiO2}) thin films have been deposited on silicon and glass substrates by the sol-gel process using titanium iso-propoxide [Ti(O-i-C3H7)4]. The bond configuration of the \ce{TiO2} thin films was analyzed by using FTIR in the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm−1. The spectral transmittance of as-deposited \ce{TiO2} films deposited on fused silica glass was measured in the wavelength range from 200 to 900 nm. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed to determine the crystallinity of the \ce{TiO2} films. As-deposited films were amorphous. As the film was annealed at higher temperature, the structure was transformed from amorphous to the anatase crystalline state. The chemical composition of the deposited film was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The films are essentially stoichiometric with carbon as the dominant impurity on the surface. Raman spectra show the characteristic of \ce{TiO2} anatase phase. The electrical properties of the \ce{TiO2} films were measured using capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage techniques. From C-V measurements, the dielectric constants were calculated to be approximately 26 for the as-deposited films and 75--82 for films annealed at 700{\textdegree}C in different atmosphere. For the as-deposited samples, the breakdown voltage was 2.7 MV/cm, and for an electric field of 1 MV/cm, the leakage current was 5 {\texttimes} 10−5 A/cm2 and the resistivity was 2.2 {\texttimes} 1010 $\Omega$-cm.",

We apply the model to a generic, symmetric, five-layer, metal/cladding/core waveguide structure using transfer matrix theory. We provide a design strategy for an efficient ultra-broadband THz emitter and apply it to polymer waveguides with a nonlinear core composed of a poled guest-host electro-optic polymer composite and pumped by a pulsed fiber laser system operating at 1567 nm. The predicted bandwidths are greater than 15 THz and we find a high conversion efficiency of 1.2 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}4 W{\textminus}1 by balancing both the modal phase-matching and effective mode attenuation.},

Polymer electro-optic materials have the necessary properties to function in photonic devices beyond the 40-GHz bandwidth currently available. An appropriate choice of polymers is shown to effectively eliminate the factors contributing to an optical modulator's decay in the high-frequency response. The resulting device modulates light with a bandwidth of 150 to 200 GHz and produces detectable modulation signal at 1.6 THz. These rates are faster than anticipated bandwidth requirements for the foreseeable future.},

The origin of the observed concentration dependence is studied using the Monte Carlo (MC) modeling. We find that presence of maximum is conditioned by the pre-poling history of the sample, when entanglement of linear dipolar structures takes place. Length of the pre-poling interval is an important kinetic parameter which differentiates between various nonexponential kinetics of build-up of polar phase responsible for strong/weak SHG susceptibility.},

Here, we demonstrate an example of such improvement achieved through exploitation of the interaction of coumarin pendant groups in chromophore-containing macromolecules. Acentric order enhancement is explained in terms of lattice-symmetry effects, where constraint of orientational degrees of freedom alters the relationship between centrosymmetric and acentric order. We demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically that lattice dimensionality can be defined using the relationship between centrosymmetric order and acentric order. Experimentally: Acentric order is determined by attenuated total reflection measurement of electro-optic activity coupled with hyper-Rayleigh scattering measurement of molecular first hyperpolarizability, and centrosymmetric order is determined by the variable angle polarization referenced absorption spectroscopy method. Theoretically: Order is determined from statistical mechanical models that predict the properties of soft condensed matter. }

In addition to HRS, these two molecules were found to exhibit substantial two-photon-induced fluorescence (TPF). The TPF spectra for these molecules were measured, and corrected HRS intensities were obtained. Using an external reference method, $\beta$ values of (1480 $\pm$ 100) $\times$ $10^{-30}$ and (1470 $\pm$ 90) $\times$ $10^{-30}$ esu were determined for the dye and polymer systems, respectively, in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1064 nm. The difference between these two values is very small and shows that the effect of polymerization on the HRS intensity, in the dilute concentration limit, is negligible. }

With the help of Onsager's theory, we have arrived at a correction factor to account for the solvent dependence of the values of the intrinsic hyperpolarizability $\beta$0.

The compact device consists of a plasmonic phase modulator that is seamlessly cointegrated with an antenna. Neither high-speed electronics nor electronic amplification is required to drive the modulator. A built-in enhancement of the electric field by a factor of 35 000 enables the direct conversion of millimeter-wave signals to the optical domain. This high enhancement is obtained via a resonant antenna that is directly coupled to an optical field by means of a plasmonic modulator. The suggested concept provides a simple and cost-efficient alternative solution to conventional schemes where millimeter-wave signals are first converted to the electrical domain before being up-converted to the optical domain. }

The time domain measurements provide direct access to both the absorption and refractive index spectra.

Resonant high-frequency polar vibrational modes are observed and assigned in polymers PA6 and PTFE, and their dielectric functions in the complete frequency window 2-15 THz are theoretically reproduced.

A series of three bis(ProDOT)-based chromophores and a bithiophene-based control chromophore were prepared and fully characterized with regard to EO applications. The highly planar bis(ProDOT) bridge results in slightly larger (∼10\%) molecular hyperpolarizability ($\beta$) values as compared to the bithiophene bridge, as measured by hyper-Rayleigh scattering at a variety of wavelengths. In amorphous polycarbonate guest-host films, however, the bulky substituents on the bis(ProDOT) bridge result in significantly larger (∼70\%) poling-induced EO coefficient (r33) values, as measured by simple reflection ellipsometry at 1310 nm. This can be attributed to a roughly 2-fold enhancement in poling efficiency due to reduced intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. This chromophore architecture also exhibits excellent temporal alignment stability and photochemical stability as compared to benchmark AJL8, FTC, and CLD chromophore systems. Incorporation of the strong CF3-phenyl-substituted tricyano-furan (TCF) acceptor into a bis(ProDOT)-based chromophore resulted in a $\beta$zzz(-2ω;ω,ω) value at 1907 nm of 5700 $\pm$ 400 $\times$ $10^{-30}$ esu and an r33 value of 69 $\pm$ 14 pm/V at 32.8 total chromophore weight \%. }

abstract={Development of organic materials for photonics applications requires simultaneous optimization of molecular and bulk properties to obtain acceptable performance in device applications. In developing organic electro-optic materials based on the Pockels effect, these properties include the molecular hyperpolarizability ($\beta$) of organic non-linear optical (ONLO) chromophores, the extent to which chromophores can be acentrically ordered in a material, the number density of chromophores (ρ N ), and the dielectric constant (varepsilon]) of the environment surrounding the chromophores. Furthermore, constraint of orientational degrees of freedom (reduced dimensionality) due to engineered non-covalent interactions and/or high chromophore loading can strongly affect acentric ordering of chromophores. This parameter space can be efficiently searched through theory-aided design, but the vast differences in the spatial scales needed to simulate each property require a multi-scale approach to computational modeling. Coarse-grained, rigid-body Monte Carlo (RBMC) calculations can be used to simulate large ensembles of chromophores and analyze the effects of steric anisotropy and dipole moment on ordering. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) calculations using classical force fields can be used to probe specific intermolecular interactions at the nanoscale, and electronic structure calculations at various levels (semi-empirical, DFT, and correlated, wavefunction-based methods such as MP2) can be used to calculate optical properties and provide parameters for lower-level (force field based) calculations. These techniques have been used to model the dielectric and phase behavior of strongly polar liquids such as acetonitrile, assist in the characterization of chomophore-containing complexes that exhibit a four-fold increase in poling efficiency compared to its parent chromophore, and in the molecular engineering of an OLNO dye for DNA-based biophotonics. Additionally, the importance of accounting for molecular shape, electrostatic boundary conditions, and choice of electronic structure methods are discussed and critically analyzed.},

    abstract = { Experimental and computational studies of the solvent dependence of the first molecular hyperpolarizability ($\beta$) for two donor-bridge-acceptor chromophores (CLD-1 and YLD156) are presented. Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) measurements are performed with 1907 nm excitation in a series of solvents with dielectric constants ranging from ∼2 (toluene) to ∼36 (acetonitrile). For both chromophores an approximately 2-fold increase in $\beta$ is observed by HRS over this range of dielectric constants. Computational studies employing a polarized continuum model to represent the solvent are capable of reproducing this experimental result. The experimental and computational results are compared to the predictions of the widely employed two-state model (TSM) for $\beta$. Surprisingly, for the chromophores studied here the TSM predicts that $\beta$ should decrease with increasing dielectric constant over the range investigated. The results presented here demonstrate that the TSM provides neither a quantitative nor qualitative description of the solvent dependence of $\beta$ for CLD-1 and YLD156. The enhancement of $\beta$ with increased dielectric constant suggests that modification of the dielectric surrounding the chromophore is one path by which the performance of nonlinear optical devices employing these chromophores may be significantly enhanced. }

abstract = { Monte Carlo statistical mechanical computer simulations of the electric-field poling of second-order nonlinear optical chromophores, characterized by large dipole moments, polarizabilities, and hyperpolarizabilities, are presented. Such theoretical analysis is critical to defining the structure/function relationships that permit maximization of electro-optic activity for  $/pi$-electron chromophore-containing polymeric materials. Polymeric electro-optic materials may, in turn, be important for high-bandwidth telecommunications, new forms of radar, and high-speed data processing. The experimentally observed maxima in plots of electro-optic activity versus chromophore number density (loading) in polymer matrices are theoretically reproduced, as are the shifts of the maxima to lower loading with increasing chromophore dipole moment. Modification of the chromophore shape to realize the maximum achievable electro-optic activity for a given  $/pi$-electron structure is discussed, as is the role of polymer electrical permittivity. Monte Carlo results are compared with the results of equilibrium statistical mechanical calculations based on the approximation of Piekara. The theoretical results presented here have led to the production of polymeric electro-optic materials that permit devices with drive voltage requirements of less than 1 V to be fabricated. Polymeric modulators now significantly exceed the performance capabilities (in terms of bandwidth and drive voltage) of electro-optic modulators based on inorganic materials.}

abstract = {CMOS-compatible optical modulators are key components for future silicon-based photonic transceivers. However, achieving low modulation voltage and high speed operation still remains a challenge. As a possible solution, the silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) platform has been proposed. In the SOH approach the optical signal is guided by a silicon waveguide while the electro-optic effect is provided by an organic cladding with a high $\chi$(2)-nonlinearity. In these modulators the optical nonlinear region needs to be connected to the modulating electrical source. This requires electrodes, which are both optically transparent and electrically highly conductive. To this end we introduce a highly conductive electron accumulation layer which is induced by an external DC ``gate'' voltage. As opposed to doping, the electron mobility is not impaired by impurity scattering. This way we demonstrate for the first time data encoding with an SOH electro-optic modulator. Using a first-generation device at a data-rate of 42.7 Gbit/s, widely open eye diagrams were recorded. The measured frequency response suggests that significantly larger data rates are feasible.},

The nanoscale confinement of the optical mode, combined with its close proximity to electrical contacts, enables the direct conversion of optical energy to electrical energy, without external bias, via optical rectification, and also enhances electro-optic modulation. We demonstrate this process for power levels in the sub-milliwatt regime, as compared to the kilowatt regime in which optical nonlinear effects are typically observed at short length scales. Our results suggest that a new class of detectors based on nonlinear optics may be practical.},

abstract = {Energy-efficient electro-optic modulators are at the heart of short-reach optical interconnects, and silicon photonics is considered the leading technology for realizing such devices. However, the performance of all-silicon devices is limited by intrinsic material properties. In particular, the absence of linear electro-optic effects in silicon renders the integration of energy-efficient photonic-electronic interfaces challenging. Silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) integration can overcome these limitations by combining nanophotonic silicon waveguides with organic cladding materials, thereby offering the prospect of designing optical properties by molecular engineering. In this paper, we demonstrate an SOH Mach-Zehnder modulator with unprecedented efficiency: the 1-mm-long device consumes only 0.7[emsp14]fJ[emsp14]bit-1 to generate a 12.5[emsp14]Gbit[emsp14]s-1 data stream with a bit-error ratio below the threshold for hard-decision forward-error correction. This power consumption represents the lowest value demonstrated for a non-resonant Mach-Zehnder modulator in any material system. It is enabled by a novel class of organic electro-optic materials that are designed for high chromophore density and enhanced molecular orientation. The device features an electro-optic coefficient of r33[ap]180[emsp14]pm[emsp14]V-1 and can be operated at data rates of up to 40[emsp14]Gbit[emsp14]s-1.}

abstract = {We demonstrate frequency comb sources based on silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) electro-optic modulators. Frequency combs with line spacings of 25 GHz and 40 GHz are generated, featuring flat-top spectra with less than 2 dB power variations over up to 7 lines. The combs are used for WDM data transmission at terabit/s data rates and distances of up to 300 km.},
